# Etch A Sketch

This project is currently in development. Etch A Sketch is a drawing toy that was quite popular many years ago. The idea of this project is to build the toy using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design Prototype

Included in the `/design` directory is a screenshot of the low-fidelity prototype. I preferred to design it first to make it easier to think about the code. Please note that it is possible that the final design differs from this.
